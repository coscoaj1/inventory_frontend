## General info

Frontend repo for Inventory Tracker app. Full CRUD funcionality. Can add thumbnail images. Chose ChakraUI for styling, and overall I am liking it. Seems a bit less bloated than other UI component libraries.



## Technologies

React.js
ChakraUI
Formik


## Features

Create an item, delete an item, update an item, view all items, etc.


## Room for improvement:

To do: 

There is alot to work on here as far as refactoring goes.  Also I have not yet optimized the frontend for any measure such as performance, accessibility, mobile
responsiveness, etc.
